# U.S. Influenza Trends & Forecasting (2000–2023)

> *“Influenza doesn't just return each season—it evolves. Tracking it is not just science, it's strategy.”*

Welcome to the **U.S. Influenza Forecasting Hub**, an interactive data science project that analyzes over two decades of CDC flu surveillance data to uncover patterns—and predict the future.

---

## Research Question

**How can historical flu trends and subtype patterns be used to forecast the emergence and severity of future influenza strains in the United States?**

This site explores that question by blending time series data, geospatial mapping, and machine learning-powered forecasting.

---

## Project Purpose

Built as a capstone for the **UVU Data Science program**, this website demonstrates:

- Data wrangling & cleaning (tidyverse, lubridate)  
- Interactive visualizations (Plotly, Leaflet, Shiny)  
- Forecasting models (Prophet)  
- Deployment via R Markdown & GitHub Pages  

The goal is to present flu surveillance data in an intuitive, accessible, and predictive format—bridging science, public health, and storytelling.

---

## Why This Matters

Influenza surveillance is crucial for:

- Tracking the rise and fall of seasonal outbreaks  
- Anticipating dominant viral strains (H1N1, H3N2, B/Yamagata, etc.)  
- Informing public health policy and vaccine development  
- Raising awareness of seasonal and pandemic-level threats  

By learning from past flu seasons, we can better prepare for what’s ahead.
