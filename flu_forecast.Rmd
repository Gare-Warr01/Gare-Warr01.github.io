## Abstract

This interactive dashboard showcases a data-driven forecasting platform developed to analyze and project influenza activity across the United States. Using historical CDC surveillance data and statistical modeling (Prophet), this tool enables real-time visualization of flu trends by subtype and location. With geospatial heatmaps, subtype selectors, and forecast confidence intervals, it supports data-driven public health decision-making.

## Summary

> **What is this dashboard?**  
> A real-time, interactive tool built to forecast influenza trends by subtype and state across the United States. It blends historical CDC data with modern time series forecasting (Prophet), enabling visual analytics and predictive modeling to enhance public health planning and influenza surveillance.

## Project Overview

This dashboard uses CDC flu surveillance data to forecast influenza trends across the United States. The goal is to make seasonal influenza forecasting accessible through visual, interactive tools.

### Technologies Used

- **R Shiny** for interactivity  
- **Leaflet** for U.S. heatmap visualizations  
- **Prophet** for time series forecasting  
- **Dygraphs** for forecast charts  
- **ggplot2** for bar chart comparisons

## Dashboard Features

| Feature               | Description                                                         |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Heatmap by State**      | Explore flu subtype intensity per U.S. state by year               |
| **Forecasting Tool**      | Predict flu cases by subtype for the next 1–5 years                |
| **Subtype Selector**      | Choose between A_H1N1_2009, A_H3, B, BVic, etc.                    |
| **State/National View**   | Toggle between individual state or national average overlay        |
| **Model Accuracy**        | Forecast includes Prophet's confidence intervals (upper/lower CI)  |

## How the Forecast Works

The app loads cleaned CDC data and uses Prophet to:

1. Visualize past flu trends by subtype and location  
2. Forecast future activity for 1 to 5 years  
3. Compare multiple subtypes with bar plots  
4. Allow users to click on the heatmap to update predictions interactively

## Forecast Method Summary

This dashboard uses a machine learning approach to model flu trends:

- Each state's yearly case totals are modeled using the **Prophet** time series framework  
- Forecasts predict flu subtype cases **1–5 years ahead**  
- Uncertainty intervals are shown to reflect variability in predictions  
- Model performance metrics (MAE, RMSE) are included to gauge reliability

## Dataset Overview

The dataset (`ICL_NREVSS_Summary.csv`) contains:

- `State` — U.S. state name  
- `Year` — Surveillance year  
- `Total_Cases` — Sum of all subtyped influenza cases  
- Subtypes:  
  - A_H1N1_2009, A_H3  
  - B, BVic, BYam  
  - H3N2v, A_H5  
  - A_Subtype_Not_Performed

<summary><strong>Click to view sample R code used for forecasting</strong></summary>

```r
# Load data and extract subtype columns
flu_data <- read_csv("ICL_NREVSS_Summary.csv")
subtype_columns <- colnames(flu_data)[!(colnames(flu_data) %in% c("State", "Year", "Total_Cases"))]

# Prophet forecast setup for a selected state and subtype
selected_state <- "California"
input_subtype <- "A_H1N1_2009"

df <- flu_data %>%
  filter(State == selected_state) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(y = sum(get(input_subtype), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(ds = as.Date(paste0(Year, "-01-01")))

# Train the Prophet model
m <- prophet(df, yearly.seasonality = TRUE)

# Forecast future cases (e.g., 5 years ahead)
future <- make_future_dataframe(m, periods = 5, freq = "year")
forecast <- predict(m, future)
```

## Sample Forecast Metrics

| Metric        | Description                           | Value (Example) |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------|
| MAE           | Mean Absolute Error of forecast       | 4.8             |
| RMSE          | Root Mean Square Error                | 6.3             |
| Peak Year     | Year of maximum predicted cases       | 2026            |
| Trend         | Whether the trend is rising or falling| Increasing      |

## Limitations & Future Work

- Forecast reliability depends on consistent historical reporting  
- Prophet assumes additive seasonality; sudden changes (e.g., pandemics) may reduce accuracy  
- Future updates may include climate variables, vaccine uptake data, or mobility trends
