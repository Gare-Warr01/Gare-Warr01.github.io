## Summary

> **What is this slide?**  
> This slide showcases a data-driven dashboard developed to forecast influenza activity across the United States. It leverages historical CDC surveillance data and applies a statistical time series forecasting model (Prophet) to project flu subtype trends one to five years into the future. The platform enables users to interact with a geospatial heatmap, select specific influenza subtypes, and visualize state-level forecasts with associated confidence intervals—supporting evidence-based public health planning and surveillance.

## Project Overview

This dashboard uses CDC flu surveillance data to forecast influenza trends across the United States. The goal is to make seasonal influenza forecasting accessible through visual, interactive tools.

### Technologies Used

- **R Shiny** for interactivity
- **Leaflet** for U.S. heatmap visualizations
- **Prophet** for time series forecasting
- **Dygraphs** for forecast charts
- **ggplot2** for bar chart comparisons

## Dashboard Features

| Feature               | Description                                                         |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Heatmap by State      | Explore flu subtype intensity per U.S. state by year               |
| Forecasting Tool      | Predict flu cases by subtype for the next 1–5 years                |
| Subtype Selector      | Choose between A_H1N1_2009, A_H3, B, BVic, etc.                    |
| State/National View   | Toggle between individual state or national average overlay        |
| Model Accuracy        | Forecast includes Prophet's confidence intervals (upper/lower CI)  |

## How the Forecast Works

The app loads cleaned CDC data and uses Prophet to:

1. Visualize past flu trends by subtype and location  
2. Forecast future activity for 1 to 5 years  
3. Compare multiple subtypes with bar plots  
4. Allow users to click on the heatmap to update predictions interactively

## Forecast Method Summary

This dashboard uses a machine learning approach to model flu trends:

- Each state's yearly case totals are modeled using the **Prophet** time series framework.
- Forecasts predict flu subtype cases **1–5 years ahead**.
- Uncertainty intervals are shown to reflect variability in predictions.
- Model performance metrics (MAE, RMSE) are included to gauge reliability.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset (`ICL_NREVSS_Summary.csv`) contains:

- `State` — U.S. state name  
- `Year` — Surveillance year  
- `Total_Cases` — Sum of all subtyped influenza cases  
- Subtypes:
  - A_H1N1_2009, A_H3
  - B, BVic, BYam
  - H3N2v, A_H5
  - A_Subtype_Not_Performed

```r
# Load data and extract subtype columns
flu_data <- read_csv("ICL_NREVSS_Summary.csv")
subtype_columns <- colnames(flu_data)[!(colnames(flu_data) %in% c("State", "Year", "Total_Cases"))]

# Prophet forecast setup for a selected state and subtype
selected_state <- "California"
input_subtype <- "A_H1N1_2009"

df <- flu_data %>%
  filter(State == selected_state) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(y = sum(get(input_subtype), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(ds = as.Date(paste0(Year, "-01-01")))

# Train the Prophet model
m <- prophet(df, yearly.seasonality = TRUE)

# Forecast future cases (e.g., 5 years ahead)
future <- make_future_dataframe(m, periods = 5, freq = "year")
forecast <- predict(m, future)
```

## Sample Forecast Metrics

| Metric        | Description                           | Value (Example) |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------|
| MAE           | Mean Absolute Error of forecast       | 4.8             |
| RMSE          | Root Mean Square Error                | 6.3             |
| Peak Year     | Year of maximum predicted cases       | 2026            |
| Trend         | Whether the trend is rising or falling| Increasing      |

## Notes

- Forecast reliability depends on consistent historical reporting
- The Prophet model includes additive seasonal components and CI bands
- Data updates will improve future model accuracy

## Forecast Method Summary

This dashboard demonstrates real-time forecasting of flu case data by:

- Using `prophet()` to model historical yearly flu counts
- Predicting values using `predict()` across user-defined future periods
- Visualizing outcomes via `dygraphs`, with optional confidence intervals and national averages

This is a forecasting tool designed to highlight annual trends, regional outbreaks, and potential flu burden through statistical modeling and visualization.
