## Project Overview

This project uses CDC flu surveillance data to forecast influenza trends across the United States using **interactive maps** and **predictive modeling**.

The dashboard is built using:
- **R Shiny** for real-time interactivity
- **Leaflet** for the U.S. heatmap visualization
- **Prophet** for time-series forecasting
- **Dygraphs** for smooth forecasting charts
- **ICL_NREVSS_Summary.csv** as the primary data source

## Dashboard Features

| Feature               | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Heatmap by State   | Explore flu subtype intensity per U.S. state by year |
| Forecasting Tool   | Predict flu cases by subtype for the next 1â€“5 years |
| Subtype Selector   | Choose between subtypes like A_H1N1_2009, A_H3, B, BVic, etc. |
| State/National View | Toggle between individual state or all-states (U.S.) view |
| Model Accuracy     | Forecast includes confidence intervals from Prophet |

## How the Forecast Works

The app loads CDC subtype case data for each state and applies a machine learning model (`prophet`) to:

1. **Visualize past trends**  
2. **Forecast upcoming flu activity**  
3. **Allow comparison between subtypes**

In state mode, the **heatmap** and **forecast plot** sync together when a state is clicked.  
In national mode, multiple subtypes can be viewed together in one graph.

## Dataset Overview

Your input data file (`ICL_NREVSS_Summary.csv`) contains:

- `State` â€” U.S. state name  
- `Year` â€” Surveillance year  
- Subtypes:  
  - A_H1N1_2009  
  - A_H3  
  - A_Subtype_Not_Performed  
  - B, BVic, BYam, H3N2v, A_H5  
- `Total_Cases` â€” Total of all subtype cases

## Sample Code Used in the App

```r
# Load data and extract subtypes
flu_data <- read_csv("ICL_NREVSS_Summary.csv")
subtype_columns <- colnames(flu_data)[!(colnames(flu_data) %in% c("State", "Year", "Total_Cases"))]

# Forecast setup
df <- flu_data %>%
  filter(State == selected_state()) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(y = sum(get(input$subtype), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(ds = as.Date(paste0(Year, "-01-01")))

m <- prophet(df, yearly.seasonality = TRUE)
future <- make_future_dataframe(m, periods = input$years, freq = "year")
forecast <- predict(m, future)
