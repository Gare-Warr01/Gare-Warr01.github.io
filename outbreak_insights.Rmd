# ILI Trends Over Time

```{r}

# Peak Flu Years (Top 5)

    Total_B = sum(Total_B, na.rm = TRUE),

# ILI vs. Confirmed Cases

```{r ili-vs-cases}

    Avg_ILI = mean(Weighted_ILI, na.rm = TRUE)

# Key Takeaways

- **2017–2018 and 2009** were among the worst flu seasons based on total cases and ILI percentages.
- **ILI trends** correlate moderately with confirmed case surges.
- **Seasonality** remains consistent, with spikes in Weeks 1–12 (if weekly data available).
