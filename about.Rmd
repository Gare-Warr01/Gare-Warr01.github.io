# About the Creator

I am **Garrett Warr**, an undergraduate biotechnology student at **Utah Valley University** with a strong academic and professional interest in **virology**, **pathology**, and **public health data science**. My work focuses on applying computational tools to real-world biological challenges—particularly those involving infectious disease dynamics and surveillance.

This website was created as the **capstone project** for my Data Science course. It integrates influenza surveillance data, time-series forecasting models, and interactive dashboards to support public health awareness and predictive analytics.

## Scientific Mission

I believe that science should not only inform, but also **empower**. My core motivation lies in transforming data into actionable insight—telling stories that uncover hidden patterns, assess public health risks, and enable more effective responses to disease outbreaks. I aim to contribute to the fields of epidemiology and translational research, where data meets decision-making.
