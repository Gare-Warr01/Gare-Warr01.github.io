# About the Creator

> *"Science is not only a disciple of reason, but, also, one of romance and passion."*  
> — Stephen Hawking

My name is **Garrett Warr**, a biotechnology student at **Utah Valley University**, driven by a deep interest in **virology**, **pathology**, and how data can be used to combat public health challenges.

This website was developed as my **final project** for a Data Science course. It brings together influenza surveillance data, time-series modeling, and web-based visualization tools to help make flu trends more understandable, actionable, and accessible.

## Scientific Mission

I believe science should not just inform — it should **empower**. I’m passionate about using data to tell meaningful stories, illuminate health risks, and support real-world decision making. My goal is to work in a research lab or epidemiological setting where I can apply data science to emerging diseases and outbreak response.
