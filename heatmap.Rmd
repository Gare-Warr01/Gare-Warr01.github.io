## Abstract

This interactive dashboard visualizes laboratory-confirmed influenza cases across U.S. states, using public data from the CDC's NREVSS program. The Shiny app enables real-time exploration of case counts by year and flu subtype, providing valuable tools for public health analysis, planning, and outreach.

## Overview

This dashboard allows users to:

- **Select from multiple flu strains** (e.g., H1N1, H3, B/Victoria, etc.)  
- **Choose a specific year** to analyze  
- **View:**  
  - A dynamic **heatmap** with case counts per state  
  - A **Top 5 leaderboard** of the most affected states  
  - A **real-time summary** of total cases

Developed in R with Shiny and hosted via [shinyapps.io](https://gare-warr01.shinyapps.io/flu_heatmap_app/), this tool is part of a data science capstone project at Utah Valley University.

## What This Dashboard Shows

- **Interactive Map**: States are color-coded based on the number of flu cases for the selected strain and year.  
- **Strain Selector**: Focus on one strain at a time (e.g., H3N2, B/Yamagata).  
- **Year Selector**: Use the year slider to explore annual trends.  
- **Top 5 States**: Sidebar leaderboard shows the highest-case states for quick comparison.  
- **Popups**: Hover or click on circles to see state-specific counts.

## Limitations & Future Work

While this tool presents a dynamic and engaging exploration of flu case data, it relies on publicly reported CDC surveillance. As such, it may underrepresent milder or unreported cases. Future enhancements may include:

- Regional overlays for population density or healthcare access  
- Live data streaming from CDC APIs  
- Integration with weather and mobility datasets

## Data Source

- **CDC NREVSS Surveillance Portal**: [https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/](https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/)  
- **Dataset**: `ICL_NREVSS_Summary.csv`, reshaped using `tidyr::pivot_longer()`
